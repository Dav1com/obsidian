Today I went to [[Facultad De Ciencias Físicas y Matemáticas|fcfm]] to the [[Módulo Interdisciplinario]] class. In the way there I remembered [[Kadense|Kada]] and I had a thought that I quite liked. We could not have worked in a romantic relationship, not because it could not have worked on its own, but because we are in a situation were it could just not work, I have dreams and stuff I wanna do, which are sadly not compatible, but somehow it soothes me to know that it was not really our fault.

I'm planning in maybe doing a [[Trabajo Dirigido]] for [[Éric Tanter|Tanter]], this could be the continuation in [[Language Semantics]] that I have been looking for

- [ ] I should send [[Éric Tanter|Tanter]] an email

15:35 I'm leaving to the date I have with [[Dante]], [[Daniel Ramirez|Dmitri]], [[Daniel Arias|Arias]] and [[Vicente Villarroel|vivi]]
